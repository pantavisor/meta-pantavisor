# Tailscale Kernel Configuration Recommendations (with nftables emphasis)

# Core Netfilter and Xtables
# Even with nftables, some xtables components might be implicitly used or provide
# broader compatibility, though nf_tables is the primary focus.
CONFIG_NETFILTER=y
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XTABLES=y # Xtables infrastructure, still useful

# Netfilter connection tracking (essential for NAT and stateful firewalling)
CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK=y
CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK_IPV4=y
CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK_IPV6=y

# Network Address Translation (NAT) - Essential for Subnet Routers/Exit Nodes
# While nftables handles NAT, these are fundamental Netfilter NAT components.
CONFIG_NF_NAT=y
CONFIG_NF_NAT_IPV4=y
CONFIG_NF_NAT_IPV6=y

# MARK target and match (used by Tailscale for internal routing/firewalling)
# These are the xtables versions. The nftables equivalent is NF_FLOWTABLE_NETDEV, NFT_MARK, etc.
# Having both is generally harmless at the kernel level.
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_MARK=y
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_MARK=y

# TUN/TAP device support (essential for virtual network interfaces)
CONFIG_TUN=y

# WireGuard (the underlying VPN protocol for Tailscale)
CONFIG_WIREGUARD=y

# IPv6 support (highly recommended for full Tailscale functionality)
CONFIG_IPV6=y
CONFIG_IPV6_ROUTER_PREF=y
CONFIG_IPV6_ROUTE_INFO=y
CONFIG_IPV6_MIP6=y
CONFIG_IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES=y

# --- NF_TABLES Specific Configuration ---
# These are crucial if your system is using nftables as its primary firewall.
# Tailscale will use the nftables Netlink API when configured to do so.
CONFIG_NF_TABLES=y
CONFIG_NF_TABLES_IPV4=y
CONFIG_NF_TABLES_IPV6=y
CONFIG_NF_TABLES_ARP=y
CONFIG_NF_TABLES_BRIDGE=y
CONFIG_NF_TABLES_NETDEV=y # Important for device-specific rules in nftables

# Common nftables extensions and targets Tailscale (and general networking) might use
CONFIG_NFT_REJECT_IPV4=y
CONFIG_NFT_REJECT_IPV6=y
CONFIG_NFT_MASQ=y # Masquerading (NAT) target for nftables
CONFIG_NFT_NAT=y   # NAT support for nftables (broader than just masq)
CONFIG_NFT_MARK=y  # Mark target for nftables (similar to xt_MARK)
CONFIG_NFT_SET_RBTREE=y # Set types for nftables (often used for sets of IPs/ports)
CONFIG_NFT_SET_HASH=y   # Set types for nftables (often used for sets of IPs/ports)
CONFIG_NFT_FIB=y # Forwarding Information Base lookup (for routing lookups in rules)
CONFIG_NFT_CHAIN_NAT_IPV4=y # NAT chain specifically for IPv4
CONFIG_NFT_CHAIN_NAT_IPV6=y # NAT chain specifically for IPv6
CONFIG_NFT_COUNTER=y # Counter support in nftables rules
CONFIG_NFT_LOG=y     # Logging in nftables rules
CONFIG_NFT_LIMIT=y   # Limit matching in nftables rules
CONFIG_NFT_HASH=y    # Hash match type for nftables

# --- Optional but often beneficial for networking in general: ---
# Bridge support (if you plan to use bridges with your network interfaces)
# CONFIG_BRIDGE=y
